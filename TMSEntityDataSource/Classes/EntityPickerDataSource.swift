/// # EntityPickerDataSource
/// `EntityPickerDataSource` is designed to take away most of the boiler plate when presenting managed objects in picker views.
///
/// To use `EntityPickerDataSource`:
/// - Call `init(pickerView: , context: , predicate: )`.
/// - If desired set `sortDescriptors` and/or `cacheName`.
/// - Call `initiateFetchRequest`.
/// - Call `entity(atRow: )` from the picker view's delegate as needed to get the entity for a particular row.
///
/// Note: `UIPickerViewDataSource` only supplies the number of components in a picker view and the number of rows in a component, the rest comes from the `UIPickerViewDelegate`.
///
/// Changes made to `sortDescriptors` or `cacheName` after iniating the fetch request will have no effect.
///
/// For picker views you should not alter `fetchBatchSize`.
///
/// Altering `sectionNameKeyPath` will have no effect for picker views.
