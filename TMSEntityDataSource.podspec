`TMSEntityDataSource` takes care of fetching the Core Data entities you want to display in a table, collection, or picker view. It also does all of the work  in the respective data source protocols. For picker views it supplies an easy way to get an entity based on an index or an index based on an entity making the delegate methods easy to write.
